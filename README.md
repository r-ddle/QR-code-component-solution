## My process

I had already made a small card like [site](https://r-ddle.netlify.app) so basically just copied the foundation of the container and card. Then the hard part was aligning and moving the text to a proper position without making them go into random places. I'm very new to web dev. so I had to search on google for everything ðŸ˜…

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit:700|Outfit:400');
```

### Continued development

I'm thinking of adding more to this site like some animations and effects even tho its just a QR code lol. Maybe when you like hover over the QR code you get the ability to veiw it in fullscreen or the background has a nice dark shade to it? somethings like that.

### Useful resources

- [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/) - This helped me to pick the colors for the page (Until I realised I was already provided with a style-guide ðŸ˜­)
