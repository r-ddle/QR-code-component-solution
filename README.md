## My process

I had already made a small card like [site](https://r-ddle.netlify.app) so basically just copied the foundation of the container and card. Then the hard part was aligning and moving the text to a proper position without making them go into random places. I'm very new to web dev. so I had to search on google for everything ðŸ˜…

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'm thinking of adding more to this site like some animations and effects even tho its just a QR code lol. Maybe when you like hover over the QR code you get the ability to veiw it in fullscreen or the background has a nice dark shade to it? somethings like that.

### Useful resources

- [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/) - This helped me to pick the colors for the page (Until I realised I was already provided with a style-guide ðŸ˜­)
